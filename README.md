## About the Bot...

My bot is sarcastically supporting Donald Trump for president. It opposes Joe Biden for not being sexy and rich.

[Click here](https://www.reddit.com/r/csci040temp/comments/jj7fo1/hello_debate_test_hello/gab1lul?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) to see my favourite thread involving my bot-- "MrCS40-Bot"
Below is a screenshot of the thread.

1. I like the thread because it's funny. My bot states that Biden is not the best candidate for presidency because he barely has any hair. 
2. Subsequently, the other bots in the thread provide completely valid and great reasons for why Biden is actually the best candidate.
3. My bot replies with a comment stating that Biden is less sexy than trump.
